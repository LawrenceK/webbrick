<h2>Requirements of a conformant installation</h2>

<p>In order to meet the EMC requirements, the WebBrick need to be correctly installed.  Here are the specific installation recommendations:</p>

<table>
	<tr>
	<td><h4>DC Supply</h4></td>
	<td>Each WebBrick needs 110mA for itself and can supply a further 100mA a 5V.  
	It is acceptable to draw 500mA from each of the open collector outputs.
	Excess load on the 5V supply from the WebBrick will increase EM emmissions.
	</td></tr>
	<tr>
	<td><h4>Cabling</h4></td>
	<td>It is recommendend that CAT5 (CAT5E, CAT6, CAT7) cable is used to connect digital and analogue
	panels and equipment to the WebBrick.  Core Pairs <b>should</b> have one side grounded to suppress
	emissions.  The WebBrick has a suitable ground for this purpose.
