\section{IO Board}
\index{IO Board}
The V6 webbrick comes with an IO board that provides screw terminal access to all connections other than the 
network cable. It also provides 4 switched mains outputs and 2 double pole changeover relay outputs.

Layout diagram In here.

\subsection{Mains Switching}
\index{Mains Switching}
The mains outputs are digital channels 1 to 4 and can each switch up to 500W, with a maximum of 1500W for the four channels.
There is a 6.3 Amp fuse in the unit that will blow if you excede this loading. These are zero voltage switched and intended 
for simple on off actions. To handle dimming use the analogue outputs connected to external dimmers.

\subsection{Relays}
\index{Relays}
Digital channels 4 and 5 are connected to relays that provide a double pole changeover capability and are rated for 4A at 230V. 

\em{6 Series} Due to internal spacing these should not be used for low voltage applications if the mains switching capability is 
used on the Triacs.

\em{7 Series} The relays are now organised so that relay 5 is a double pole changeover and relay 4 is presented as single pole changeover.  
Internally the connections for relay 4 are paralleled.  This gives a current rating of 4A at 230V for relay 5 and 8A at 230V for relay 4.

The arrangement of the live side protective ground has been changed so that low voltages can be used on the relays whilst mains is present on the triacs. 



\subsection{Connections}
\index{Connections}

The IO board has a total of 6 connectors on it, 2 are 9 way and 4 are 12 way. The 9 way connectors are used for the 
mains outputs and the 12 way for inputs and low voltage outputs.
