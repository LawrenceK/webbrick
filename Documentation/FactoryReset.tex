\subsection{Resetting a WebBrick to factory defaults}
\index{Factory Reset}

To perform a factory reset there is a small switch located internally above one of the 12 pin screw connectors, the top right one.
This resets the webrick to factory default, including the IP address. 
This should be pushed whilst the WebBrick is powered up (A credit card inserted horizontally above the connector should do well). 
Remove mains power to the device whilst doing this.

If you can connect to the webrick and login to it you can also go to Manual commands and enter FR and click Send.

You should see the HeartBeat LED flash very quickly, then after about 5 seconds settle to its normal blink rate.
