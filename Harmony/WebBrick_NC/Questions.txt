RegisterNativeController ??

RegisterDevice parameters? and can I set the the address?
Param1, Param2, Param3

Format of sParams on HarmonyCallMethod . Is sDeviceName part of sParams.

Name of plugin seems to need to start HPI_

Name of DLL for native controller seems to need to match register name.


HAPI CreateZone <component (controller name)> <zone name>
Plugin CreateZone <zone name>

HAPI SetDeviceZone <component> <device name> <zone name>
plugin SetDeviceZone <device name> <zone name>

HAPI SetDeviceAddress <component> <device name> <address string>
plugin SetDeviceAddress <device name> <address string>

HAPI SetDeviceType <component> <device name> <device type>
plugin SetDeviceType <device name> <device type>



ToDo
----

RegisterDiscretes if needed for WWB specific actions.

RegisterEvent for each channel for High, Low, Activity.
-- Can have a single device with multiple events for each input.

RaiseEvent then is configured to trigger a method on a device.

DimTo is a jump to to a setting
FadeTo is ramp to a setting.

How do (Registermethod and ) Use -- RegisterDiscreets differ
