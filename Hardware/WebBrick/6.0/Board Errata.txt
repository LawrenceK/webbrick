WebBrick 6-64 tasks
-------------------

Checklist
=========


a) Check that VSS, V- and GND are all the same net.

b) Check that all pins on Digital and Analogue buses are connected

c) Check that V+ goes to Quad Op Amp

Tasks
=====

16 May 2006
Issues affecting Revision 3 hardware 

i) Use taller male connector, at least 3mm.
ii)Adjust screw hole positions, slightly too close.
v) Ensure parts list updated before next manufaacture, lower profile replays.

Future enhancements
=================

i) Change RJ45 socket so we can access POE power connections.

HISTORICAL
===========
Pre May 2006

xa) Change to 1 relay

b) Create space for 3mm mains separation

xc) Remember heat sinks for triacs

d) Add holes for light pipes

xe) Change regulated side cap to 100uf

f) Try to lose 0.1" from length of board


IO Board
========

 --- Change to 4 layer ---

xa) 1 wire pull up

?b) provision for mimics (i.e.) DIL switch

xc) ROT pull-ups

xd) change to 3.5mm pitch

xe) 12V *to* WebBrick 6-64


IO Board Remedial
=================

xROT pull-ups are in fact pull down ! -- Needs changing a documentation!

xOptoTriacs are too close together

Use lower profile relays


ABL Heatsinks

100 PPC50 black anodised @ 1.50


WebBrick 6-64 remedial tasks
============================

a) AVDD and AVSS (decouple)

b) change element to use GND instead of AVSS to solve confusion

c) Decouple at input and programming connector

xd) Decouple SP with 10NF

e) Check what signals go to the IO board -- I2C and second UART.
