Cabling.
========

The factory test harness connects WebBrick  outputs to WebBrick inouts so that most 
of the inputs/outputs can be tested automatically.

As there are a large number of outputs there are two plugs (Plug A & Plug B) that connect 
to the digital inputs, one from the Mimics and one from the digital outputs/open collector outputs.

i) Connect Mimics 1-8 to Digital In 1-8 (Plug A)

ii) Connect O/C output 1-4 to Digital input 1-4 Plug B. Also connect O/C 1-4 to 5V using a 
Pullup resistor of between 1K and 10K.

iii)Connect Digital outputs 5-8 to digital input 5-8 Plug B.

iv) Connect Analogue outputs 1-4 to Analogue input 1-4 using a 1K resistor and also
connect analogue input 1-4 to ground using a 1K resistor. This is to divide the analogue
output by 2 as ii is 0-10V and the input is 0-5V.

v) Connect all relay NO contacts to 5V

vi) Connect all relay NO contacts to 0V

vii) Connect relay C(ommon) contacts to the monitor inputs. 5A to monitor 1, 5B to monitor 2,
 6A to monitor 3 & 6B to monitor 3.

viii) connect 12v supply to top right connector.

To Come:
========
Using the temperature sensors to test the mains triacs. By using small 15W bulbs and clipping a 
temp sensor to each one. Requires 5 temperature sensors so we can also detect bacjground temperature.

Notes:
======
oV and 5V are available on the middle bottom connector, as part fo the 1 wire bus.

=================

Digitals

a) This first of all sets all digital input trigger actions to None and the fade rate to 1 so the
analogue inputs shift faster.

b) Then sets all digital outputs to off and reads the inputs to detect whether we are testing Mimics or 
Open Collector outputs (these switch the ground rail, hence are pulled up to 5V).

c) Then for each output sets output high and verifies that only this input has gone high.

d) Sets all outputs high and for each output sets it low and verifies that only one input low.

Analogues

a) Set all analogues to 0%

b) The test then sets all the outputs not on test to a sequence of levels. And at each level sets the 
output under test to a set of levels. At each point it verifies that all the inputs are at the expected
levels. This verifies that we have no interaction between each level. At present the steps are 20%.

Monitors/Relays.
a) Set all outputs to off

b) Switch each relay and verify all the monitor inputs are as expected.
