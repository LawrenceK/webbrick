Mimic/SoftSerial support.

Currently Timer4 overflows at .4mS - this is 0.1us FOsc/4 *16 Prescaler * 256 PR4
If we set PR4 to 130 we get Bit rate for 4800 Baud. And we get Minimum Mimic Freq of 75Hz.
If we up the number of steps to 128 (Code expects power of 2 then this drops MinFreq to 37.5Hz when on or 
off single time slot. 

Need to investigate time in Mimic IRQ handler
Identify max time in handler allowed, in machine instructions?

Timer4 Interrupt every 400uS current may be every 200uS.
Current: Fixed Interrupt overhead - Cpu+WizC =
SerialIntHandler At 9600 Baud will interrupt at circa 1250uS (8N2)
Mimic 21 machine cycles - some 2 word instructions. = 2.1uS
If we do a DMX send at 250KBaud this is a byte every 48uS. (8N2) So IRQ handler for second serial needs to be tighter...

Add watchdog clear in init code. fedpic simulator issues. And Siteplayer timeout on simulate

Wb63. changes
parse - ban characters, 
parse - do RU on RS.
Action Up and Down, 
    for digital next/prev up/down treated as On/Off
    for scene up/down treated as next/prev
    analogue handle up/down as rotary step up/down
DI option 4 - rotary encoder.
Time sent every minute and upTime.
Use data structure for digitals

09/05
Add sequence number into UDP packets, single byte, bumped by wb on each send.

25/04
Add IR send as possible action, channel nr may be a problem due to size. we only have 4 bits.
Use associated value? as part of data?

Triggers display not handling signed values (Temperature!)
Make output type depend on Action Type.

TODO js.
Ensure webbrick handles Temperture output type.
parse to verify action and outout type are consistant.

-- PIC allows for 8 dwells and 8 setpoints.

07/03/2006
-- FadeRate called as soon as msTick > fadeRate so if adjusted down to be under msTick it does not wait until wrap..
-- Have added an extra byte to triggers associated value not currently used.
-- Have added 5th byte to digin, options. Currently trigger rise,fall edge.
-- Have made analogue dwells return to last set point.
-- Action Set Threshold and Adjust Threshold use associated value. Need to enhance lib.js as need to select target type etc.

27/02/2006
-- Re-run scheduled events at start up. (Toggle hartbeat)
-- clock read at startup and at 30secs every minute.
-- Mimics not optional.
-- DI Options now in DI definition and in Xml. Optional on CD command.
-- No Monitors. NameMonitor removed.
-- On bad password check for level 1 blank
-- Check IP address valid.
-- Add parsing to handle extended trigger.

Scheduled events
Allow for repeat very hour/minute events.

Thoughts

Over 16 bits.
Currently 4 is channel Nr.
3 Is SetPoint
1 is channel type.
2 is Dwell
2 is UDP type.
4 is action type.

So combine action type and dwell nr.
Combine channel type, Number and setpoint.

Thoughts
Encode Dwells with Actions in 5 bits
11xxx Dwell Can xxx
10xxx Dwell xxx
00000 No Action
00xx1 - 01xxx Others
Combine channel, type and setpoint in 5 bits?
000000 - 001111, 16 dig channels
010000 - 011111, spare
100xxx
101xxx
110xxx
111xxx
